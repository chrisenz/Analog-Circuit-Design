# OTA with Capacitive Feedback - Large-signal Step Response

This notebook presents the analysis of the step response of a capacitively coupled OTA. It first derives the small-signal step response and settling time and then derives the large-signal step response and sttling time accounting for the effect of slew-rate coming from the input differential pair of a single-stage OTA. The small- and large-signal step response are validated by simulations with ngspice.
