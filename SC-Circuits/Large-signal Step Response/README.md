# OTA with Capacitive Feedback - Large-signal Step Response

![OTA with capacitive feedback](/img/OTA_with_capacitive_feedback.png)

This [notebook](Large_signal_step_response.pdf) presents the analysis of the step response of a capacitively coupled OTA. It first derives the small-signal step response and settling time and then derives the large-signal step response and settling time accounting for the effect of slew-rate coming from the input differential pair of a single-stage OTA. The small- and large-signal step responses are validated by simulations with ngspice.
