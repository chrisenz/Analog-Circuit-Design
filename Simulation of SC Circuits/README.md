# AC simulattion technique of switched-capacitros circuits with a standard Spice simulator such as LTSpice or ngspice

This directory contains all the tools to do AC simulation of switched-capacitor (SC) circuits with LTSpice or ngspice. The quarto notebook explains the theory behind this technique and gives sevral SC filter examples. The LTSpice examples includes the schematic which can be captured in LTSpice using the library
