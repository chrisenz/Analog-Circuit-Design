# Design of the Simple OTA

![Simple OTA.](/Amplifiers/OTAs/Simple%20OTA/Figures/Simple_OTA.png)

This directory contains all files required to design the simple 5 transistors OTA shown above using the EKV design methodology with the inversion coefficient for a generic 180nm bulk CMOS process. The circuit is simulated with ngspice using the EKV 2.6 compact model using the paramters corresponding to this generic 180 nm CMOS process.
The design and simulations are perfomed from Quatro.

If your are just interested in learning about the EKV methodology that is used for the design of this OTA, you can simply read the [report](/Amplifiers/OTAs/Simple%20OTA/Simple_OTA.pdf).
