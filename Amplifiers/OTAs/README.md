# Design of Various Operational Transconductance Amplifiers (OTAs)

This repository presents the design of various operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) usign the EKV design methodology with the inversion coefficient. They are designed and simulated for a generic 180 nm bulk CMOS process. The simulations are performed with ngspice using the EKV 2.6 compact model.

The design and simulations are performed from Quatro. You can modify the Quatro documents and design for different specifications for the 180 nm process. For this you need to install Quatro and ngspice. To run the ngspice simulations you need to ![install ngspice](/ngspice_installation.md).
