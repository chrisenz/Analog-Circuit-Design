# Design of Various Operational Transconductance Amplifiers (OTAs)

This repository presents the design of various operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) usign the EKV design methodology with the inversion coefficient. They are design and simulated for a generic 180 nm bulk CMOS process. The simulations are performed with ngspice using the EKV 2.6 compact model.

The folder currently includes:
* [The simple 5 transistors OTA.](/Amplifiers/OTAs/Simple%20OTA/) ([pdf](/Amplifiers/OTAs/Simple%20OTA/Simple_OTA.pdf))
* [The symmetrical OTA.](/Amplifiers/OTAs/Symmetrical%20OTA/) ([pdf](/Amplifiers/OTAs/Symmetrical%20OTA/Symmetrical_OTA.pdf))

To run the ngspice simulations you need to ![install ngspice](/ngspice_installation.md).
