This [Quarto notebook](/Amplifiers/Basic/CS%20OL%20Noise%20Optimization/CS_OL_noise_optimization.pdf) investigates the optimization of the input-referred white noise power spectral density (PSD) of a common-source gain stage. It starts first by looking at the minimum current needed to achieve a given input-referred thermal noise resistance. It then shows that there is an optimum inversion coefficient for which the input-referred thermal noise resistance is minimum.
