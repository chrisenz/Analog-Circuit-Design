# Analog-Circuit-Design

This repository presents various examples of analog circuit design. It currently includes:
* [AC simulation of switched-capacitor circuits using a standard Spice simulator such as LTSpice or ngspice.](/
* * [Common-source gain stage optimization](/Circuit%20Examples/CS%20Optimization/) for minimum current consumption.
