# Analog-Circuit-Design

This repository presents various examples of analog CMOS circuit design. It is focused on the use of the EKV MOSFET model and the related inversion coefficient approach. It is structured in the following Chapters.

## Amplifiers

### Basic

#### Common-source stage with capacitive feedback

### OTAs
#### Simple OTA

#### Symmetrical OTA

#### Miller OTA

#### Telescopic OTA

#### Folded-cascode OTA


## SC-Circuits

* [AC simulation of switched-capacitor circuits using a standard Spice simulator such as LTSpice or ngspice.](/Simulation%20of%20SC%20Circuits/) ([pdf](/Simulation%20of%20SC%20Circuits/SCC_simulation.pdf))

To run the ngspice simulations you need to ![install ngspice](/ngspice_installation.md).
